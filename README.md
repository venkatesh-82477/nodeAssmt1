<h3>Explain node.js ?</h3>
<p>
*  Node.js is the open source,cross platform,JavaScript runtime environment built on chrome's v8 JavaScript engine that executes<br>
JavaScript code outside a web browser.
</p>
<p>
*  When you view a webpage in your browser, you are making a request to another computer on the internet, which then provides you the webpage as a response. That computer you are talking to via the internet is a web server. A web server receives HTTP requests from a client, like your browser, and provides an HTTP response, like an HTML page or JSON from an API.
